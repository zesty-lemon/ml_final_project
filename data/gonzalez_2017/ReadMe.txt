This dataset consists of 500 vertical acceleration time series, sampled at 50 Hz, 100 for each of five categories of road
anomalies: asphalt bumps, metal bumps, potholes, regular road and worn-out road segments. We used a Bag of Words strategy
to detect and classify these different types of anomalies in this paper. [attached pdf]
